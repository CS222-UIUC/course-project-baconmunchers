## Campus Scheduling Map
Empty classrooms are popular study spots, but you never know when there might be a class. Our application will show a map of several buildings on campus with class timings for each room, so students know when classes will be and how long they can stay.

## Django Usage

cd into the scraperbackend folder of the repository, then type the following command:
python manage.py runserver

Then in a brower, enter the following url:
http://localhost:8000/get_class/
